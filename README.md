# WHOOT
Weird Hacks &amp; Other Offensive Tools

# What is this?
WHOOT is a curated chaos-pile of scripts, snippets, and other strange creations I've written, found, or stitched together for offensive security.
This is not a framework, a proper toolset, or anything you'd cite in a DEF CON talk. It's a personal lab notebook with execution permissions.

# What's in the folder?
  - Scripts for recon, enumeration, and chaos deployment
  - Bash, Python, and the occasional regrettable one-liner
  - Tools with names like extract_sqli_vomit.sh
  - Stuff I only understand after 3 Coffee

# FQA 
Will this help you?
  Maybe.
Will it work in your environment?
  No idea.
Does it come with docs?
  WHOOT no.
But you're smart, you'll figure it out or break something trying.

# Warning
WHOOT may cause:
  - Log pollution
  - Firewall bans
  - Existential questions about your own code
  - Unwanted root shells (or lack thereof)

This is my mess. You clone it at your own risk.

# Disclaimer (READ THIS)
 - I am not responsible for anything that happens when you run any of these scripts.
 - If it wipes something: not my fault.
 - If it gets you banned: not my fault.
 - If it emails your boss, NSA, or your cat: still not my fault.
 - If you don’t read the code before executing it: that is your fault.

This is a collection of tools I use personally. Use them at your own risk, ideally in a lab, not in production, and definitely not during a job interview.

# License
WTFPL — Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License

Because you shouldn’t need permission to run weird scripts on even weirder networks.

# Final squawk
If you find something useful in here, great.
If not, at least you can enjoy the filenames.
Either way… WHOOT WHOOT
